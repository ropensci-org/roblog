# roblog

Are you preparing a blog post or tech note for rOpenSci? Stay here! The goal of roblog is to provide guidance (docs!) and practical helpers (templates! checklists! functions!) for authors of blog posts and tech notes on rOpenSci website. 

We're looking forward to reading your content!

## Start here

First read [the content guidance](/content-guidelines.html) then the technical guidance.

## (R) Markdown templates

If you want to execute code, use the R Markdown post template. If not, use a Markdown post template. In both cases, use the Markdown author file template to store information such as your name, online presence.

The helpers will create an untitled file with the template in RStudio. Do not forget to save it. Save R Markdown files as .Rmd and Markdown files as .md.


## Installation

``` r
install.packages("roblog", repos = "https://dev.ropensci.org")
```
