You don't _have_ to locally preview your post, you could rely on the preview that will appear in your pull request.

First [add your post](https://docs.ropensci.org/roblog/articles/pr-guidance.html#add-your-post).

The version of Hugo used by the server is defined in [netlify.toml](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/netlify.toml) but don't downgrade if you've got a newer Hugo version!

To install Hugo locally, refer to [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) or run `blogdown::install_hugo()`.

Then run `hugo serve` in the repo directory to start a local server on [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313). To view a future-dated blog post, use `hugo serve -F`.
