# roblog

The goal of roblog is to provide (practical) guidance for authors of
blog posts and tech notes on rOpenSci blog. Weâ€™re thrilled that you want
to write for our blogs, and looking forward to reading your content\!

## (R) Markdown templates

If you want to execute code, use the R Markdown post template. If not,
use a Markdown post template. In both cases, use the Markdown author
file template to store information such as your name, online presence.

The helpers will create an untitled file with the template in RStudio.
Do not forget to save it. Save R Markdown files as .Rmd and Markdown
files as .md.
