helpers (templates\! checklists\! functions\!) for authors of blog posts
and tech notes on rOpenSci website.

    to resources.

      - either directly as a Markdown file
      - or from R Markdown If you want to execute code, use the R
        Markdown post template. If not, use a Markdown post template.

    metadata 2) a **folder** under `content/blog/` or
    `content/technotes/` with the post, optionally its source, the
    images.
